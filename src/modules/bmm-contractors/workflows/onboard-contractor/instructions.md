  name: '' # Display name
  email: '' # Primary email for communication

  # Role
  role: '' # backend-dev, frontend-dev, mobile-dev, qa-engineer, researcher

  # Technical
  tech_stack: [] # Primary technologies/skills
  specialties: [] # Areas of expertise

  # Availability
  availability: '' # full-time, part-time, on-call
  timezone: '' # e.g., "UTC+5:30"
  working_hours: '' # e.g., "09:00-17:00"

  # Capacity
  capacity_story_points_per_sprint: 0
  max_concurrent_stories: 3

  # Communication
  response_sla_hours: 24
  preferred_contact: 'email' # SMTP email only
```

**Questions to Ask:**

### Stage 2: Create Profile

**Objective:** Create contractor profile in configuration.

**Generate Contractor ID:**
Format: `{role}-{number}`
Example: `backend-002`, `frontend-001`

**Create Profile Entry:**

Add to `config.yaml` contractors section:

```yaml
contractors:
  # ... existing contractors ...

  - id: 'backend-002'
    name: 'New Backend Developer'
    email: 'newdev@contractor.example'
    role: 'backend-dev'
    tech_stack:
      - 'Java 21'
      - 'Spring Boot'
      - 'PostgreSQL'
    specialties:
      - 'REST APIs'
      - 'Microservices'
    availability: 'full-time'
    timezone: 'UTC+5:30'
    working_hours: '09:00-17:00'
    response_sla_hours: 24
    capacity_story_points_per_sprint: 18
    active: true
    onboarded_at: '2025-11-28T10:00:00Z'
```

**Load Role Profile:**

Based on role, load the profile template:

- `backend-dev.profile.yaml` → Technical context, standards, checklist
- `frontend-dev.profile.yaml` → UI standards, component patterns
- etc.

**Output:** Profile created and saved

---

### Stage 3: Provision Access

**Objective:** Set up necessary access for the contractor.

**Git Access:**

```yaml
git_access:
  provider: 'github'
  organization: 'your-org'
  repository: 'your-repo'

  permissions:
    - read: true
    - write: true # To their branches only
    - admin: false

  branch_rules:
    - can_push_to: 'story/*'
    - cannot_push_to: ['main', 'develop']
```

**Actions:**

1. [ ] Add contractor to GitHub organization (or invite as collaborator)
2. [ ] Set up branch protection rules
3. [ ] Create SSH key or personal access token instructions

**Communication Access:**

```yaml
communication:
  email:
    - Verify email deliverability
    - Add to allowed senders list
    - Test email round-trip

  optional:
    - Documentation access (shared via email)
    - Issue tracker access (notifications via email)
```

**Verification:**

- [ ] Contractor can clone repository
- [ ] Contractor can push to feature branches
- [ ] Contractor can create pull requests
- [ ] Email delivery confirmed

**Output:** Access provisioned and verified

    - name: 'Project README'
      url: 'https://github.com/org/repo/README.md'
    - name: 'Architecture Overview'
