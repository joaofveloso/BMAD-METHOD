# Escalate Blocker Workflow

## Overview

This workflow manages the escalation of contractor blockers via SMTP email. It ensures blockers are routed to the right people with full context and tracked until resolution.

## Prerequisites

- Contractor has reported a blocker (BLOCKED command)
- Or: Blocker detected through other means (standup, SLA breach)
- Module state accessible

---

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Identify Blocker

**Objective:** Load blocker details and context.

**Blocker Sources:**

1. **Contractor Email** - Parse BLOCKED command:

   ```
   From: backend@contractor.example
   Subject: Re: [PROJECT] [STORY-123] Story Assignment

   BLOCKED - Cannot access staging database. Getting connection refused errors.
   Tried from local and CI environments, same result.

   Error: Connection refused to staging-db.example.com:5432
   ```

2. **Standup Detection** - Blocker identified during standup
3. **SLA Breach** - Automatic detection of stalled work
4. **Manual Report** - Coordinator-identified blocker

**Load Blocker Context:**

```yaml
blocker:
  id: 'BLK-2025-001'
  reported_at: '2025-11-28T10:30:00Z'
  reported_by: 'backend-001'
  contractor_name: 'Backend Developer'
  contractor_email: 'backend@contractor.example'

  # Source
  source: 'email'
  email_correlation_id: 'assign-STORY-123-backend-001'

  # Story context
  story_id: 'STORY-123'
  story_title: 'Implement user authentication API'
  story_priority: 'high'

  # Blocker details
  description: 'Cannot access staging database'
  details: |
    Getting connection refused errors.
    Tried from local and CI environments, same result.
    Error: Connection refused to staging-db.example.com:5432

  # Duration
  blocked_since: '2025-11-28T10:30:00Z'
  hours_blocked: 26
```

**Output:** Complete blocker context loaded

---

### Stage 2: Classify Blocker

**Objective:** Determine blocker type, severity, and resolution owner.

**Blocker Types:**

| Type           | Description                     | Typical Owner  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Access         | Permission/credential issues    | DevOps/Admin   |
| Infrastructure | System/environment problems     | DevOps         |
| Dependency     | Waiting on another story/team   | PM/Coordinator |
| Technical      | Code/architecture questions     | Tech Lead      |
| Requirements   | Unclear or missing requirements | PM/PO          |
| External       | Third-party dependency          | Varies         |
| Resource       | Missing tools, licenses, data   | Admin          |

**Severity Levels:**

| Severity    | Criteria                                     | Response Time |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 🔴 Critical | Blocks multiple contractors or critical path | 4 hours       |
| 🟠 High     | Blocks single contractor on priority work    | 8 hours       |
| 🟡 Medium   | Blocks work but workarounds exist            | 24 hours      |
| 🟢 Low      | Minor impediment                             | 48 hours      |

**Classification:**

```yaml
classification:
  type: 'infrastructure'
  subtype: 'database_access'
  severity: 'high'
  reason: 'Blocks priority story, no workaround'

  # Resolution routing
  resolution_owner: 'devops'
  resolution_owner_email: 'devops@yourcompany.com'
  backup_owner: 'tech-lead'

  # Impact assessment
  impact:
    stories_blocked: 1
    contractors_blocked: 1
    is_critical_path: true
    downstream_impact:
      - 'STORY-124 depends on STORY-123 completion'
      - 'STORY-125 blocked by same issue'

  # SLA
  response_sla_hours: 8
  resolution_sla_hours: 24
```

**Pattern Detection:**

```yaml
pattern_check:
  similar_blockers:
    - BLK-2025-098 # Same staging DB issue 2 weeks ago
  recurring: true
  frequency: '2 times in 30 days'
  recommendation: 'Consider systemic fix for staging DB access'
```

**Output:** Blocker classified and routed

---

### Stage 3: Determine Recipients

**Objective:** Identify all parties who should receive the escalation.

**Recipient Rules:**

```yaml
recipient_rules:
  - type: 'infrastructure'
    primary: ['devops@yourcompany.com']
    cc: ['coordinator@yourcompany.com']

  - type: 'dependency'
    primary: ['blocking_story_owner']
    cc: ['coordinator@yourcompany.com', 'pm@yourcompany.com']

  - type: 'requirements'
    primary: ['pm@yourcompany.com', 'po@yourcompany.com']
    cc: ['coordinator@yourcompany.com']

  - severity: 'critical'
    always_cc: ['lead@yourcompany.com', 'manager@yourcompany.com']
```

**Determined Recipients:**

```yaml
recipients:
  to:
    - email: 'devops@yourcompany.com'
      name: 'DevOps Team'
      reason: 'Infrastructure owner'

  cc:
    - email: 'coordinator@yourcompany.com'
      name: 'Project Coordinator'
      reason: 'Tracking'
    - email: 'backend@contractor.example'
      name: 'Backend Developer'
      reason: 'Blocked contractor (keep informed)'

  reply_to: 'coordinator@yourcompany.com'
```

**Output:** Recipient list determined

---

### Stage 4: Prepare Escalation

**Objective:** Compose escalation email with full context.

**Escalation Email Template:**

```markdown
Subject: [PROJECT] 🚨 BLOCKER: Cannot access staging database - STORY-123

## Escalation Summary

| Field          | Value                             |

| Severity       | 🟠 HIGH                           |
| Type           | Infrastructure / Database Access  |
| Blocked Since  | Nov 28, 2025 10:30 UTC (26 hours) |
| Response SLA   | 8 hours                           |
| Resolution SLA | 24 hours                          |

## Tips for Effective Escalation

1. **Include full context** - Async recipients need complete information
2. **Clear severity** - Make urgency obvious immediately
3. **Specific asks** - Tell recipient exactly what's needed
4. **Track patterns** - Recurring blockers need systemic fixes
5. **Keep contractor informed** - They're waiting and anxious
6. **Respect SLAs** - Escalate promptly, not prematurely
7. **Close the loop** - Always send resolution notification
