# Review Contractor Submission Workflow

## Overview

This workflow guides the review of a contractor's code submission. It combines code review, QA validation, and compliance checks to ensure quality before merging.

## Prerequisites

- Contractor has submitted work (SUBMITTED command or PR opened)
- PR exists and CI checks are passing
- Story context available

---

**Review Comments Format:**

````markdown
### File: src/auth/AuthService.java

**Line 45-52: [BLOCKER]**
Missing input validation on email parameter. This could allow injection.

Suggestion:

```java
if (!EmailValidator.isValid(email)) {
    throw new ValidationException("Invalid email format");
}
```
````

**Line 78: [SUGGESTION]**
Consider extracting this logic to a separate method for reusability.

```

**Code Review Summary:**
| Category | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Functionality | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Count |
| Code Quality | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Count |
| Architecture | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Count |

### Stage 3: QA Review

**Objective:** Verify test coverage and acceptance criteria.

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
```

Coverage Report:

- Overall: 85%
- New Code: 92%
- Critical Paths: 100%

Test Types:

- Unit Tests: 24 added
- Integration Tests: 5 added
- E2E Tests: 0 (not required)

````

**Acceptance Criteria Validation:**

| # | Criterion | Test Coverage | Manual Verified |
|---|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | POST /auth/login returns JWT token | ✅ Unit + Integration | ✅ |
| 2 | POST /auth/logout invalidates token | ✅ Unit | ✅ |
| 3 | POST /auth/refresh extends token | ✅ Unit + Integration | ✅ |
| 4 | 95% test coverage | ✅ 92% new code | - |

**Exploratory Testing Results:**
- Tested happy path: ✅
- Tested invalid inputs: ✅
- Tested edge cases: ✅
- Tested error scenarios: ✅

**Issues Found:**
```markdown
### QA-001: [MINOR]
Token expiry message could be more descriptive.
Currently: "Token expired"
Suggested: "Token expired. Please login again."

### QA-002: [BLOCKER]
Refresh token can be reused after logout.
Steps: Login → Logout → Use old refresh token → Still works
Expected: Should return 401

```

### Revision Request Comment (GitHub PR)

````markdown
## 🔄 Changes Requested

Good progress, but some issues need addressing before merge.

### Required Changes

#### 1. Security: Refresh Token Reuse (Blocker)

**Location:** `AuthService.java:89`

Refresh tokens can be reused after logout. This is a security vulnerability.

**Fix:** Invalidate refresh token on logout.

```java
public void logout(String refreshToken) {
    refreshTokenRepository.invalidate(refreshToken);  // Add this
    // ... existing code
}
```
````

### Optional Improvements

- More descriptive error messages

Please address the required changes and reply with SUBMITTED when ready.

## Tips for Effective Reviews

1. **Be specific** - Point to exact lines and provide examples
2. **Explain why** - Help contractor learn, not just fix
3. **Prioritize** - Clearly distinguish blockers from nice-to-haves
4. **Be timely** - Review within SLA (24 hours)
5. **Be constructive** - Focus on code, not person
6. **Acknowledge good work** - Positive feedback matters
