# BMM-Release Module

Release Management module for the BMAD Method. Handles release planning, candidate validation, release notes generation, and rollback procedures.

## Overview

The bmm-release module provides:

- **Release Planning**: Create and manage release candidates
- **Release Notes Generation**: Auto-generate release notes from completed stories
- **Rollback Planning**: Define and execute rollback procedures
- **Release Validation**: Coordinate with bmm-metrics for quality gate checks

## Event-Driven Architecture

This module operates through events, making it completely decoupled from other modules:

### Events Subscribed

| Event                  | Action                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `metrics.quality.pass` | Proceeds with release if quality gates pass         |
| `metrics.quality.fail` | Blocks release and notifies stakeholders            |
| `story.done`           | Adds story to pending release items                 |
| `sprint.ended`         | Triggers release candidate creation (if configured) |

### Events Published

| Event                        | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `release.candidate.created`  | New release candidate ready for validation |
| `release.approved`           | Release approved after all gates pass      |
| `release.deployed`           | Release successfully deployed              |
| `release.failed`             | Release deployment failed                  |
| `release.rollback.initiated` | Rollback procedure started                 |
| `release.rollback.completed` | Rollback completed successfully            |

## Quick Start

1. Install the module via BMAD installer
2. Configure release settings in `.bmad/bmm-release/config.yaml`
3. Use the Release Manager agent: `*release-manager`

## Agent Commands

The Release Manager agent provides:

- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*plan-release` - Create a new release candidate
- `*release-notes` - Generate release notes
- `*rollback-plan` - Create rollback procedure
- `*release-status` - Check current release status
- `*exit` - Exit agent

## Integration with bmm-metrics

The release workflow integrates with bmm-metrics through events:

1. Release candidate created → `release.candidate.created`
2. bmm-metrics receives event → runs quality gate check
3. Quality gate result → `metrics.quality.pass` or `metrics.quality.fail`
4. bmm-release receives result → proceeds or blocks release

This event-driven approach means modules are completely independent and can operate asynchronously.

## Configuration

```yaml
# .bmad/bmm-release/config.yaml
project_name: 'My Project'
user_name: 'Developer'

release:
  versioning: 'semver' # semver, calver, custom
  auto_create_on_sprint_end: true
  require_quality_gates: true
  require_changelog: true

deployment:
  environments:
    - staging
    - production
  approval_required:
    staging: false
    production: true

rollback:
  auto_rollback_on_failure: true
  health_check_timeout: 300 # seconds
```

## Verification Protocol

All bmm-release agents and workflows must follow the **[Verification Protocol](../../core/docs/verification-protocol.md)**.

- Never claim success without actual verification
- Distinguish between "configured" and "confirmed working"
- Test end-to-end flows, not just individual components
- Report clearly what was verified vs. what remains untested
