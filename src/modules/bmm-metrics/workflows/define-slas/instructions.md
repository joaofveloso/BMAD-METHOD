# Define SLAs Instructions

## Objective

Define Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with clear thresholds, monitoring rules, and escalation procedures to ensure consistent delivery and quality standards.

## Prerequisites

- KPIs defined (run `*define-kpis` first if not done)
- Understanding of team capacity and realistic targets
- Stakeholder agreement on acceptable service levels

<step n="1" goal="Understand SLA requirements">

### Understand SLA Context

<ask>What type of SLAs would you like to define?
[d] Delivery SLAs - Story cycle time, sprint completion, release frequency
[q] Quality SLAs - Test coverage, defect rates, review turnaround
[o] Operations SLAs - Uptime, response time, incident resolution
[a] All of the above

Choice: </ask>

<action>Store as {{sla_category}}</action>

<ask>What is the business context for these SLAs?
(e.g., "Client contract requirements", "Internal quality standards", "Compliance requirements")

Context: </ask>

<action>Store as {{sla_context}}</action>

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Story Cycle Time       | Max days from start to done          | 5 days                  |
| Sprint Completion Rate | Min % of committed stories completed | 80%                     |

| Bug Fix SLA            | Max time to fix by severity          | P1: 4h, P2: 24h, P3: 1w |

<ask>Define your delivery SLAs:

**Story Cycle Time**

- Target (green): \_\_\_ days
- Warning (yellow): \_\_\_ days
- Breach (red): \_\_\_ days

**Sprint Completion Rate**

**PR Review Turnaround**

- Target (green): \_\_\_ hours
- Warning (yellow): \_\_\_ hours
- Breach (red): \_\_\_ hours

Enter values: </ask>

<action>Parse and store as {{delivery_slas}}</action>

<ask>Should delivery SLAs be blocking for releases?
[y] Yes - Breach prevents release
[n] No - Warning only, allow release
[s] Some - Select which are blocking

Response: </ask>

<action>Store blocking configuration</action>

## Completion

SLA definition complete.

**Summary:**

- **Total SLAs Defined:** {{total_sla_count}}
- **Blocking SLAs:** {{blocking_sla_count}}
- **Categories:** {{categories_list}}
- **Definition File:** {{output_file_path}}

**Next Steps:**

1. Review SLA definitions with stakeholders
2. Configure monitoring dashboards
3. Set up alerting integrations
4. Communicate SLAs to the team

Use `*sla-status` to check current compliance.
