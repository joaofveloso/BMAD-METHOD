### Product KPIs

<template-guidance>
For each product KPI, we need:
- Name and description
- Formula/calculation method
- Target value and threshold levels
- Measurement frequency
- Owner responsible for tracking
</template-guidance>

**Recommended Product KPIs:**

| Feature Adoption Rate   | % of users using new features          | 20-40%         |
| User Retention (D7/D30) | % of users returning after 7/30 days   | 40%/20%        |
| NPS Score               | Net Promoter Score                     | >30            |

[a] User Activation Rate
[b] Feature Adoption Rate
[c] User Retention
[d] NPS Score
[e] Time to Value
[f] Custom (describe)

## Completion

KPI definition complete.

**Summary:**

- **Total KPIs Defined:** {{total_kpi_count}}
- **Categories:** {{categories_list}}
- **Review Frequency:** {{review_frequency}}
- **Definition File:** {{output_file_path}}

**Next Steps:**

1. Share KPI definitions with stakeholders for review
2. Configure dashboards to display KPI values
3. Set up alerting for threshold breaches
4. Begin baseline measurement period if needed

Use `*track-metrics` to start collecting KPI values.
