# Feature Decision Workflow (Go/No-Go)

## Overview

This workflow provides a structured framework for making major product decisions. It ensures decisions are made deliberately with clear rationale, not reactively or politically.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this for decisions that are:

- **Significant:** More than a few days of work
- **Strategic:** Affects product direction or positioning
- **Irreversible:** Hard to undo once started
- **Resource-intensive:** Requires significant investment

## Decision Options

| Decision  | Meaning                   | When to Use                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **GO**    | Commit resources, proceed | High confidence, strategic fit, acceptable risk |
| **NO-GO** | Reject, do not proceed    | Poor fit, high risk, better alternatives exist  |
| **DEFER** | Not now, revisit later    | Need more information, timing not right         |

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Understand the Initiative

**Objective:** Ensure complete clarity on what is being proposed.

**Questions to answer:**

1. **What exactly is being proposed?**
   - Feature/product description in 2-3 sentences
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who requested this? (Customer, team, competitive pressure)

2. **What does success look like?**
   - How would we know if this succeeded?
   - What metrics would change?

3. **What's the scope?**
   - MVP scope vs. full vision
   - Timeline estimate
   - Resource requirements

**Clarity Check:**

- Can you explain this to someone unfamiliar in 30 seconds?
- Is there ambiguity about what we'd actually build?
- Do we have clear acceptance criteria?

**Output:** Clear initiative description

### Stage 2: Strategic Fit Assessment

**Objective:** Evaluate alignment with vision and current priorities.

**Strategic Alignment Scorecard:**

| Question                                  | Score (1-5) | Notes |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Does this align with our vision?          |             |       |
| Does this serve our target customer?      |             |       |
| Does this strengthen our differentiation? |             |       |
| Does this align with current priorities?  |             |       |
| Would this help or hurt focus?            |             |       |

**Scoring:**

- 5: Strongly supports
- 3: Neutral
- 1: Works against

**Priority Conflict Check:**

- Does this compete with current priorities for resources?
- Would this delay existing commitments?
- Is this more important than what we're already doing?

**Strategic Fit Score:** [Sum / 25] = X%

| Score  | Interpretation                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 80%+   | Strong strategic fit                 |
| 60-79% | Moderate fit, consider tradeoffs     |
| <60%   | Weak fit, needs strong justification |

**Output:** Strategic fit assessment

### Stage 3: Impact Analysis

**Objective:** Assess the potential positive and negative outcomes.

**Positive Impact Assessment:**

| Impact Area          | Expected Impact | Confidence     | Evidence         |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Revenue              | [High/Med/Low]  | [High/Med/Low] | [What evidence?] |
| User acquisition     |                 |                |                  |
| User retention       |                 |                |                  |
| User satisfaction    |                 |                |                  |
| Competitive position |                 |                |                  |
| Technical capability |                 |                |                  |

**Negative Impact Assessment:**

| Risk               | Potential Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Technical debt     |                  |            |            |
| Scope creep        |                  |            |            |
| Customer confusion |                  |            |            |
| Team burnout       |                  |            |            |
| Opportunity cost   |                  |            |            |

**Opportunity Cost:**

> "What are we NOT doing by doing this?"

- [Alternative 1 we won't pursue]
- [Alternative 2 we won't pursue]
- [Feature/fix that gets delayed]

**Output:** Impact analysis summary

### Stage 4: Risk Assessment

**Objective:** Identify and evaluate risks.

**Risk Categories:**

**1. Execution Risk**

- Do we have the skills to build this?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are there technical unknowns?

**2. Market Risk**

- Will customers actually want this?
- Is the timing right?
- Will competitors respond?

**3. Business Risk**

- Can we afford this investment?
- What if it fails?
- Are there regulatory concerns?

**Risk Matrix:**

| Risk     | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Mitigation |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| [Risk 1] |                  |              |       |            |
| [Risk 2] |                  |              |       |            |
| [Risk 3] |                  |              |       |            |

**Risk Tolerance Check:**

- What's the worst case scenario?
- Can we survive the worst case?
- Is this a reversible or irreversible decision?

**Reversibility Assessment:**

- **Easily reversible:** Low-risk, can experiment
- **Partially reversible:** Some sunk cost but can pivot
- **Irreversible:** High commitment, proceed carefully

**Output:** Risk assessment with mitigations

### Stage 5: Make Decision

**Objective:** Decide: GO, NO-GO, or DEFER.

**Decision Framework:**

```
                    Strategic Fit
                    High        Low
                 ┌─────────┬─────────┐
         High    │   GO    │ DEFER/  │
Impact          │         │ NO-GO   │
         Low    │ DEFER   │ NO-GO   │
                 └─────────┴─────────┘
```

**GO Criteria (all must be true):**

- [ ] Strategic fit score ≥ 60%
- [ ] Expected impact justifies investment
- [ ] Risks are acceptable and mitigated
- [ ] Resources are available
- [ ] Team has capacity and capability
- [ ] Not conflicting with higher priorities

**NO-GO Criteria (any is sufficient):**

- [ ] Poor strategic fit (<50%)
- [ ] Unacceptable or unmitigatable risks
- [ ] Better alternatives exist
- [ ] Insufficient resources or capability
- [ ] Would derail critical priorities

**DEFER Criteria:**

- [ ] Good idea but timing is wrong
- [ ] Need more information to decide
- [ ] Waiting on external dependencies
- [ ] Current priorities must complete first

---

### Stage 6: Document & Communicate

**Objective:** Record the decision and next steps.

**Decision Record:**

```yaml
decision:
  id: '[DECISION-XXX]'
  date: '[Date]'
  initiative: '[Name]'
  decision: '[GO | NO-GO | DEFER]'

  rationale: |
    [2-3 sentences explaining why]

  # If GO:
  next_steps:
    - '[Action 1]'
    - '[Action 2]'
  owner: '[Name]'
  deadline: '[Date]'
  success_criteria:
    - '[Criterion 1]'
    - '[Criterion 2]'

  # If NO-GO:
  alternatives_considered:
    - '[Alternative 1]'
  revisit_conditions: '[What would change our mind]'

  # If DEFER:
  revisit_date: '[Date]'
  information_needed:
    - '[What we need to know]'
```

**Communication:**

| Audience     | What to Share                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Team         | Decision + rationale + impact on them |
| Stakeholders | Decision + high-level rationale       |
| Requestor    | Decision + detailed rationale         |

## Downstream Effects

| Decision | Other Agents                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GO       | Compliance reviews, Growth plans measurement, UX plans design |
| NO-GO    | No downstream actions                                         |
| DEFER    | Calendar reminder set for revisit                             |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **HIPPO Decisions** - Don't decide just because the Highest Paid Person's Opinion says so
2. **Analysis Paralysis** - Don't defer indefinitely; set a deadline
3. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Past investment doesn't justify future investment
4. **Scope Creep in Disguise** - One feature hiding many
5. **Decision by Committee** - One person must own the decision
